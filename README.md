- Showcase different **chicken breeds** with short descriptions.

- Build a clean **developer workflow** (build pipeline, deployment).

## Current Progress

## Next Steps

- [ ] Design and structure the layout of the website  
- [ ] Implement scroll-triggered animations  
- [ ] Build and optimize the deployment pipeline  

## Notes
This project is mainly for **learning purposes** and will be part of my developer portfolio once completed.
